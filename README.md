## My process
So I kinda cheated and found a finished version of the challenge and basically traced it. I am going back through the code and adding comments to elements for my own future reference.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
I learned what a flexbox was and when to use that instead of a grid for screen optimization.

### Continued development
I will re-do this challenge again from the applying what I've learned and try to add slight style differences

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This helped me understand what flexboxes are and how to use them
- [Amjad12](https://github.com/Amjad12-10) - I used their solution to the challenge as my template
